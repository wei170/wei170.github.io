      <description>Classification Now we are switching from regression problems to classification problems. Don&amp;rsquo;t be confused by the name &amp;ldquo;Logistic Regression&amp;rdquo;; it is named that way for historical reasons and is actually an approach to classification problems, not regression problems.
Binary Classification Problem y can take on only two values, 0 and 1
Hypothesis Representation We could approach the classification problem ignoring the fact that y is discrete-valued, and use our old linear regression algorithm to try to predict y given x.</description>

      <description>Mutiple Features Linear regression with multiple variables is also known as multivariate linear regression.
The notation for equations:
$$ x_j^{(i)} = \text{value of feature } j \text{ in the }i^{th}\text{ training example} $$
$$ x^{(i)} = \text{the input (features) of the }i^{th}\text{ training example} $$
$$ m = \text{the number of training examples} $$
$$ n = \text{the number of features} $$
The multivariable form of the hypothesis function:</description>

      <description>The Hypothesis Function $$\hat{y} = h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$$
Cost Function To measure the accuracy of the hypothesis function. This takes an average (actually a fancier version of an average) of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x&amp;rsquo;s compared to the actual output y&amp;rsquo;s.
$$J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \dfrac{1}{2m} \displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^m \left( \hat{y}_i- y_i \right)^2 = \dfrac{1}{2m} \displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^m \left (h _\theta(x_i) - y_i \right)^2$$</description>

      <title>Overview of The Cellular Drone Development</title>

      <description>Overview I named this project DCenter for Drone Center, hoping that it can develop into a centralized platform that support commercial drones to fly half-autonomously with collision avoidance and stream data and 4K video to any user.
Currently, I setup a simplified infrastructure on the Heroku and GCP, and build an Android app as both the adaptor and the controller of the drone. Cellular Drone blog will give you a more comprehensive view of the whole project and the evaluation of the current stage.</description>

      <description>Motivation Over the past few years, drones have become central to the functions of various businesses and governmental organizations and have managed to pierce through areas where certain industries were either stagnant or lagging behind.
However, almost all the commercial drones are controlled with the remote controller via the WiFi connection, which highly restricts the scope of the mobility and scale of discovery. In addition, the WiFi network is not secure.</description>
