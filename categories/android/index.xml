      <description>Overview I named this project DCenter for Drone Center, hoping that it can develop into a centralized platform that support commercial drones to fly half-autonomously with collision avoidance and stream data and 4K video to any user.
Currently, I setup a simplified infrastructure on the Heroku and GCP, and build an Android app as both the adaptor and the controller of the drone. Cellular Drone blog will give you a more comprehensive view of the whole project and the evaluation of the current stage.</description>

      <description>Motivation Over the past few years, drones have become central to the functions of various businesses and governmental organizations and have managed to pierce through areas where certain industries were either stagnant or lagging behind.
However, almost all the commercial drones are controlled with the remote controller via the WiFi connection, which highly restricts the scope of the mobility and scale of discovery. In addition, the WiFi network is not secure.</description>
